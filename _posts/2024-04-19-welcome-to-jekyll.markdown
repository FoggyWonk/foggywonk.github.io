Hello, fellow internet user! My name is Brady and this is my personal website.
I will use it to share things deemed relevant to the broader world or maybe 
just things I would like to share! Have yourself a peruse. Thanks for visiting!


By the way, check out [A Simple Memory Game][A Simple Memory Game] I made for a 
game jam using godot. This was my first complete from scratch game (using assets) 
that I aim to build upon in the future.
